A quick script for zapier to ingest a webhook and sanitize your screen.cloud screens

Load this pythong into zapier after ingesting an a webhook with a duration, I recomend parsing out two durations a "real" duration in minutes and one for miliseconds

Based on docs here https://signage.screen.cloud/help/api Note this appearst to only work with static images and not app content
